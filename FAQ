What is ShaderDSL.js? 

ShaderDSL.js allows you to write GLSL shaders in plain JavaScript, instead of the C like (GLSL) language used today. 

Why ShaderDSL.js? 

We wanted to experiment with a more approachable way for web developers to author shaders, hence the use of JavaScript.

Do I need to enable special flags or use a specific browser to play with ShaderDSL.js?

No, ShaderDSL.js relies only on the portable, pure Javascript part of RiverTrail, and works in all the browsers with WebGL enabled (Firefox, Chrome, Safari).

What is the status of ShaderDSL.js?

The project is an experiment and not intended to be used in production. If you are interested in contributing, please do, we want this project to be a playground for new ways of authoring shaders.
